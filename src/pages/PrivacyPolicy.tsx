        any of its products or services. It also describes the choices available
        to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can

      <h2>Collection of Personal Information</h2>

        number) is not transferred to the third party. We may share data with
        trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or

        such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information

        processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security
        measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store
        personal data. We restrict access to personal information to our
        employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in
        order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are
        bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline,
        including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet
        these obligations.
      </p>
